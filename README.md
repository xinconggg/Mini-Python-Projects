## [Turtle Crossing](https://github.com/xinconggg/Mini-Python-Projects/blob/master/Turtle%20Crossing.py)
- Game Mechanics: This project implements a simple turtle graphics-based game where the player navigates a turtle character through a traffic of cars. The player controls the turtle using the 'w', 's', 'a', and 'd' keys to move up, down, left, and right respectively. The objective is to avoid collisions with randomly generated cars and reach the finish line at the top of the screen.
- Dynamic Difficulty: As the game progresses, the difficulty increases dynamically. The speed of the cars spawned increases incrementally, providing a greater challenge for the player. This gradual speed increment enhances the game's replay value and adds to the sense of accomplishment as players progress through levels.
- Score Tracking and Game Over: The game includes a scoreboard that displays the current level. Each time the player successfully reaches the finish line, the level increases, and the speed of car spawning increases. If the player collides with any car, the game ends, displaying a "GAME OVER" message on the scoreboard. This clear feedback loop informs the player of their progress and performance within the game.

## [Pomodoro Timer](https://github.com/xinconggg/Mini-Python-Projects/blob/master/Pomodoro.py)
- Purpose and Functionality: This project implements a Pomodoro timer, a productivity tool that uses timed intervals to break work into focused sessions (25 minutes of work) and short (5 minutes) or long (20 minutes) breaks.
- User Interface: The application features a graphical user interface created with Tkinter. It includes a countdown timer displayed over an image of a tomato, start and reset buttons, and labels for indicating the current phase (work or break) and completed work sessions.
- Core Mechanisms: The timer operates in cycles, with the start_timer function managing the transition between work and break periods based on the number of completed sessions (reps). The count_down function handles the countdown mechanism, updating the timer display every second.
- Customization and Styling: The project uses various constants and configurations to set up colors, font styles, and the overall layout of the application. Labels and buttons are styled for clarity and ease of use.
- Reset Functionality: A reset button allows users to cancel the ongoing timer and reset the display, labels, and internal counters, providing a fresh start for the timer at any point.

## [Password Generator & Manager](https://github.com/xinconggg/Mini-Python-Projects/blob/master/Password%20Generator%20%26%20Manager.py)
- Password Generation: The project includes a feature that generates secure passwords using a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols, ensuring strong and varied password creation.
- User Interface: Built with Tkinter, the GUI includes fields for entering website names, email addresses/usernames, and generated passwords, along with buttons for generating passwords and saving entries.
- Data Storage: It saves the entered and generated data (website, email, password) to a file (data.txt), appending each new entry on a new line, enabling simple password management.
- Error Handling: The program incorporates basic validation to ensure no fields are left empty before saving data, providing user prompts for confirmation and error messages when necessary.
- Usability Features: The interface ensures user-friendly interactions, such as setting focus on the website entry field on startup and clearing entry fields after saving data to streamline the process of adding new passwords.

## [Guessing US States](https://github.com/xinconggg/Mini-Python-Projects/blob/master/US%20States%20Game.py)
- Interactive Game: Players are prompted to guess the names of US states in an interactive turtle graphics window.
- Data Visualization: Correctly guessed states are displayed on a blank US map image at their respective coordinates.
- CSV Integration: State names and coordinates are loaded from a CSV file, and unguessed states are saved to a CSV file when the game ends.
- User Feedback: The game continuously updates the number of correctly guessed states in the prompt title.
